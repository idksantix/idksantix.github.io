## Overview

This repository hosts a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testbench and simulator designed for developing an autonomous airlock control system. Our goal is to prepare for the European Rover Challenge 2025. The testbench integrates various technologies, including Arduino, ESP32, and Python, to create a robust and efficient control system for rover operations.

You can download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/idksantix/Airlock-Control-System-HIL-Testbench/releases). Make sure to execute the necessary files to get started.

## Usage

Once you have set up the testbench, you can begin using it:

- **Start the Simulation**: Run the main script to initialize the system.
- **Monitor Outputs**: Use the graphical interface to observe system performance and control parameters.
- **Adjust Settings**: Modify parameters as needed for different test scenarios.
- **Log Data**: Collect data for analysis after each test run.

## Testing

Testing is a crucial part of the development process. The HIL testbench allows you to simulate various conditions to evaluate system performance.

1. **Unit Tests**: Each module should be tested independently to ensure correct functionality.
2. **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between different modules and hardware components.
3. **System Tests**: Run full simulations to assess overall system performance under various conditions.

To run the tests, navigate to the `tests` directory and execute the test scripts:
```bash
cd tests
pytest
```
